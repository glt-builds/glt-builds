### 🧠 Idea Lab Projects

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 💡 [**RPS for Good**](https://github.com/glt-builds/rps-for-good) | Solana Devnet charity experiment — rock-paper-scissors game where winners donate SOL to on-chain causes. |
| 🍜 [**Yumaya**](https://github.com/glt-builds/yumaya) | Gamified ramen discovery app using Solana location tags and map integration. |
| 🧱 [**Solana Block Stats**](https://github.com/glt-builds/solana_block_stats) | Rust CLI that queries real-time Solana RPC block data with auto-fallback. |
| ⚡ [**Phoenix Signal Viewer**](https://github.com/glt-builds/phoenix_signal_viewer) | (WIP) Live order-book signal dashboard built with the Phoenix SDK and async Rust. |
