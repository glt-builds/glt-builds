### 💡 Current Build

#### ⚡ **Phoenix Signal Viewer**
Real-time Rust + Solana project analyzing order-book activity on the **Phoenix DEX**.  
The goal: extract trading signals directly from on-chain data — measuring liquidity, bid/ask imbalance, and price flow in real time.

> Built entirely in public — experimenting with low-latency Rust systems and Solana’s high-performance runtime.
